    A GameState class contains a dictionary of dictionaries called entire_state that holds all the state data of a game. 
    It has the format: 
    entire_state = {

    It is important to note that location data is stored relative to each player. For this reason, players 
    have the same spawn and can have overlapping pieces. This also means a transformation is performed 
    every time a player gets the position of enemy pieces.  

    A GameState class has many methods such as run_action and get_actions that manipulate and derive info from state data.
